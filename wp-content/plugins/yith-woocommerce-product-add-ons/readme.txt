Increase average order value by letting your customers purchase additional options on your products.

== Description ==

YITH Product Add-ons & Extra options is a powerful tool that you can use to create and sell advanced products or services by adding custom options in your product pages. And with **our new redesign** we’ve added a lot of new exciting features!

You can now create **unlimited blocks of options**, show them on all products, or just specific products or categories, and choose from different types of add-ons: radio elements, select dropdown, input textboxes, checkboxes, etc. You can either **set a cost for each option, make it free**, or even **discount the product price** if the option is selected. 

This plugin is an easy solution to **sell customizable products** (for example, if you sell t-shirts or jewels, you can add a radio button to let users choose whether to customize  it or not, and then show an input field where they can type in the text for print or engraving) **or products that need advanced options** (for example, you sell a product box and let your users select the number of products to add: you can charge them an additional cost for extra products and let them select a shipping option from a list of available carriers). 

The options selected and the information submitted by the customers will be included in the order details.

== Installation ==
Important: First of all, you have to download and activate WooCommerce plugin, which is mandatory for YITH WooCommerce Product Add-Ons to be working.

1. Unzip the downloaded zip file.
2. Upload the plugin folder into the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress site.
3. Activate `YITH WooCommerce Product Add-Ons` from Plugins page.

= Configuration =
YITH WooCommerce Product Add-Ons will add a new tab called "Products Add-Ons" in "YIT Plugins" menu item. There, you will find all Yithemes plugins with quick access to plugin setting page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I add options groups on variable products? =
Yes, the plugin allows to do it. Options can be configured globally on product, but not on single variation.

= Can I disable global options on single product? =
Yes, you can do it, but not singularly. From the product editing page, you can disable the use of "all" global options groups.

= I would like to show an option only when a specific combination of options chosen from users occurs. How can I do it? =
You must enable the dependency on the option you are interested in by inserting the name of options you want your users to select.
